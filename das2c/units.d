/** Enumeration of unit types, that correspond to physical unit types.
 *
 * Note that although these are strings, Units_fromStr() should be be
 * used to get a reference to the enumerated string since *pointer equality*
 * comparison is done in the code.  Thus UnitType objects created using the
 * functions in this module satisfy the rule:
 *
 * @code
 *   das_unit a;
 *   das_unit b;
 *
 *   if(a == b){
 *     // Units are equal
 *   }
 * @endcode
 *
 * The Epoch Time unit types understood by this library are:
 *
 *   - UNIT_US2000 - Non-Leap microseconds since midnight, January 1st 2000
 *   - UNIT_MJ1958 - Days since midnight January 1st 1958
 *   - UNIT_T2000  - Non-Leap seconds since midnight, January 1st 2000
 *   - UNIT_T1970  - Non-Leap seconds since midnight, January 1st 1970
 *   - UNIT_UTC    - Time strings on the gregorian calendar
 *   - UNIT_NS2020 - Non-Leap nanoseconds since midnight Jan 1st, 2020,
 *                   typically transmitted as signed 8-byte integers
 *
 * As it stands the library currently does not understand SI prefixes, so
 * each scaled unit has it's own entry.  This should change.
 *
 *   - UNIT_SECONDS - Seconds, a time span.
 *   - UNIT_HOURS - hours, a time span = 3600 seconds.
 *   - UNIT_MIRCOSECONDS - A smaller time span.
 *   - UNIT_HERTZ   - Hertz, a measure of frequency.
 *   - UNIT_KILO_HERTZ - KiloHertz, another measure of frequency.
 *   - UNIT_E_SPECDENS - Electric Spectral Density, V**2 m**-2 Hz**-1;
 *   - UNIT_B_SPECDENS - Magnetic Spectral Density, nT**2 Hz**-1;
 *   - UNIT_NT      - Magnetic Field intensity, nT
 *   - UNIT_NUMBER_DENS - Number density, the number of items in a cubic
		 centimeter
 *   - UNIT_DB      - Decibels, a ratio measure, typically versus 1.0.
 *   - UNIT_KM      - Kilometers, a unit of distance
 *   - UNIT_DEGREES - Degrees, a ratio measure on circles: (arch length / circumference) * 360
 *
 * And if you don't know what else to use, try this:
 *
 *   - UNIT_DIMENSIONLESS - I.E. No units
 *
 * @todo Redo units as small structures
