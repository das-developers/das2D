/** Das2 fexible variables
 *
 * Like arrays, das2 variables are objects which produce values given a set
 * of indicies.  Unlike arrays the indicies provided need not correspond to
 * the actual layout of the data on the disk.
 *
 * To illustrate the difference between arrays and das2 variables consider the
 * following arrays containing a typical set of values for time, frequency,
 * amplitude spectrogram.
 *
 * @code
 *  double time[1440];       // Time values at which frequency sweeps were triggered
 *  double frequency[42];    // Center frequencies for each energy channel
 *  double energy[1440][42]; // Energies measured for each frequency band in each sweep
 * @endcode
 *
 * So to get a correlated triplet of two coordinate values at index (14,34)
 * would look like
 *
 * @code
 *  x = time[14]
 *  y = frequency[34]
 *  z = energy[14][34]
 * @endcode
 *
 * In contrast if the time, frequency and energy data were stored in a
 * correlated set of das2 variables accessing the values would look like
 * this:
 *
 * @code
 * DasVar* vTime = new_DasVarArry(time, MAP_2(0,DEGEN));
 * DasVar* vFrequency = new_DasVarArray(frequency, MAP_2(DEGEN, 0));
 * DasVar* vEnergy = new_DasVarArray(energy, MAP_2(0, 1));
 *
 * // A correlated set is now:
 *  x = fTime([14,34]);
 *  y = fFreqency([14,34]);
 *  z = fEnergy([14,34]);
 * @endcode
 *
 * In addition to wrapping arrays, das2 variables may produce data via
 * calculations involving other variables.  For example:
 *
 * @code
 *
 * // The premise here is that we are reading in an array of Mars Express
 * // spacecraft altitudes.  We know the delay timing for the MARSIS instrument
 * // and need a way to get the altitude at which the radar return signal was
 * // generated.  We'll assume that there is nothing to bounce off of near
 * // the spacecraft except the planet below.  So the altitude at which the
 * // signal was generated is just the craft altitude minus a range which is
 * // calculated from the return time.
 *
 * // Create a dynamic array of altitudes.  We don't know how big this will
 * // get or how large it is any any moment.
 * Array* pAltAry = new_DasAry("altitude", etDouble, 0, NULL, RANK_1(0));
 *
 * // Create a fixed array of delay times.  There are 80 delay time measurements
 * // of the MARSIS radar for each altitude.
 * Array* pDelayAry = new_DasAry("delay", etDouble, 0, NULL, RANK_1(80));
 * // Fill in array values here
 *
 * // We want an automatic variable that will give us the altitude of the
 * // return signals no mater how many altitude values we get.  To do this
 * // we need to do the calculation:
 * //
 * //  Signal_Altitude = Craft_Altitude - (Speed_of_Light/2) * Delay_Time
 * //
 * // on any altitude we happen to have.  Since we have a variable number of
 * // altitudes but a fixed number of delay times it's natural to store these
 * // values in a 2-index array, namely:
 * //
 * // Signal_Altitude[i][j] where i marks the altitude and j marks the delay.
 * //
 * // So we are going to use the MAP_2 macro to map real array indices into
 * // virtual indexes.
 *
 * // Map index 0 pAlt to index 0 of a Rank 2 index space
 * DasVar* pAlt = new_DasVar_array(pAltAry, MAP_2(0, DEGEN), Units_fromStr("km"));
 *
 * // Map index 0 of pDelay to index 1 of a Rank 2 index space
 * DasVar* pDelay = new_DasVar_array(pDelayAry, MAP_2(DEGEN, 0), "Î¼s");
 *
 * // We need a constant. (Memory note, Variables copy the contents of the
 * // constant internally so it's okay to initialize constants with stack
 * // variables.)
 * int nConst = 299792 / 2;
 * DasVar* pConst = new_DasVar_const(etInt, &nConst, "km s**-1");
 *
 * // Multiply the constant times the delay time to get the range.  Constants
 * // always return the same value for any index provided, thus they can be
 * // combined with anything.
 * DasVar* pRange = DasVar_binaryOp(&pConst, "*", pDelay);
 *
 * // Subtract the range from the spacecraft altitude.  Since vAlt and vDelay
 * // have the same rank (due to index remapping) we can setup an element by
 * // element binary operation
 * DasVar* pSigAlt = DasVar_binaryOp( &pAlt, "-", &pRange);
 *
 * // Here's how to get data out of the resulting variable
 * double sigHeight = DasVar_double(&vSigAlt, IDX2(1234, 77));
 *
 * // The component variables are evaluated in the same index space
 * double craftAlt = DasVar_double(&vAlt, IDX2(1234,77));
 * double range = DasVar_double(&vRange, IDX2(1234,77));
 *
 * // If the same set of data are going to be evaluated multiple times it
 * // might be faster to just re-write all the internal data at a certain
 * // point into a new array.
 * DasVar* pEvalAlt = DasVar_evaluate(pSigAlt);
 *
 * @endcode
 *
 * In the example above the variable tree was created manually.  To support
 * Das2.3 general streams expressions like the following will be parsable
 * by the dataset object:
 * @code
 *
 * DasVar* pSigAlt;
 * pSigAlt = Dataset_eval(pDs, "$altitude[i] - (3.0e9 / 2)*delay[j]", "km" );
 *
 *
 * @endcode
 *
 * To keep variables light weight (especially constants) they use stack value
 * semantics instead of heap value semantics.  This is a pain because you can't
 * just return variables from functions, as they may reference other variables
 * and you end up with dangling pointers.  On the other hand, using stack
 * semantics results in less heap fragmentation and thus faster code on current
 * processors.  Also simultaneous data reads are thread safe.  Writes can be too
 * so long as different threads write to different index ranges.
